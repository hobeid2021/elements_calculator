# Usage
For the most part it works like a normal REPL calculator with the usual math functions and operators.
Such as +, -, *, /, pow, sqrt, etc...
However this calculator has an additional feature, whereby typing in a symbol of a chemical element (such as C or H)
will be substitute for the element's atomic mass.
